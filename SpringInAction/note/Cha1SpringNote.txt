                    Whereas WAR files are perfect suitable for deploying to a traditional Java application server,
                    they're not a natural fit for most cloud platforms.

                    If you are willing to deploy an application to a traditional Java application server, then you'll need to choose
                    WAR packaging and include a web initializer class. (In chapter 2)

                        #   be freed from the burden of worry about library version, but Spring Boot version.

                <plugin>
                    #   It provides a Maven goal that enables you run the application using Maven.
                    #   It ensures that all dependency libraries are included within the executable JAR file and available on the runtime classpath.
                    #   It produces a manifest file in the JAR file that denotes the bootstrap class (TacoCloudApplication.class) as the main class
                        for the executable JAR.

                            -i.e. rename - the package of some of the dependencies.

            -   Maven Wrapper
                >   an excellent choice for projects that need a special version of Maven.
                    Instead of installing many versions of it in the operating system, we can just use the project-specific wrapper script.
                >   use these scripts to build your project even if you don't have Maven installed on your machine.
